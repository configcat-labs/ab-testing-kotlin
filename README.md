# Running and A/B Test in Android (Kotlin) Using ConfigCat and Amplitude

In this repository you will find an Android(Kotlin) application that shows a simple page. The application uses a feature flag, handled through [ConfigCat's](https://configcat.com) management system, in order to change the button's text from "Subscribe Now!" to "Subscribe Now! $4.99". The application is also connected to Amplitude and sends event data to the amplitude server using an SDK key, to make A/B testing possible.
